I will need to write this at some point but for now it will be used as a check list:

- [x] Config class- Do as needed
- [x] Game class
- [x] Shared storage class
- [x] Replay buffer class
- [x] Monte Carlo Search Tree Class
- [ ] Neural Nets
- [ ] Training method
- [x] Data worker class-> requires the neural net to figure out but nearly there
- [ ] Implement classic control instantiations
- [ ] Implement atari version
